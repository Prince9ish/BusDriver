The dilemma of trusting your child to an unknown stranger is an extremely tough position to be in, throw in the treacherous roads of developing countries such as Thailand. Then trusting the life of your child to school bus seems like a critical decision. Our project aspired to resolve this issue through the utilisation of technology.

## Hardware Used
The process of our system is the same every day. When students get on the bus, they have to tap RFID tags with the reader on the bus. The reader is connected with the driver’s tablet. The application on the tablet will then update the student status to the Cloud Firestore. After that, the notification will be shown on the parent’s application.
